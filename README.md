 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndrewMcKean. I'm currently in the middle of a career switch from Nursing to software engineering, a big switch! 
 
 ðŸŒ± I've been working for the last 2 years as a React Native Developer for a small, health technology company where we create, primarily, AAC applications.
 
 ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using GitHub to find some open source projects which are healthcare oriented to sharpen my skills in my spare time, though I haven't done so as yet.
 
 âš¡I'm currently working with:
 - TypeScript, with React & React Native
 - Swift & Java, for native modules in iOS React Native projects
 - and, Python for scripting

 ðŸ’­ I'm currently learning:
 - Backend development with boot.dev
 - Python with boot.dev
 - GO with boot.dev


I haven't been a big social media user in the past but am looking to use it more as a networking tool. 

With that in mind I'm reachable at:
- Twitter: @andrewmckean_
- (WIP)LinkedIn: /in/andrewmckean-
